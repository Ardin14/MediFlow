## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **React Router 6** for navigation
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Lucide React** for icons

- **Cloudflare D1** SQLite database
- **@getmocha/users-service** for authentication

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks "Sign In with Google"
2. Redirected to Google OAuth
3. Authorization code exchanged for session token
4. Session token stored in HTTP-only cookie
5. Subsequent requests authenticated via cookie

### Data Flow
1. React components make API calls to Hono backend
2. Backend validates authentication and role permissions
3. Database queries executed via D1 SQL interface
4. Results returned to frontend and rendered
